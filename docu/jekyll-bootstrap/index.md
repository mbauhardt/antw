### About
Antw is a wrapper for apache ant. Antw attach at runtime a bunch of loggers to log some helpful statistics about your build. All statistics are logged to a directory called *antw* located in your build directory (usually *build/antw*).


### What antw will do for you
Antw will download and install apache ant version 1.8.3 for you under directory
    
    ~/.antw/install/contrib

It provides a script that use a set of loggers. Not more.
